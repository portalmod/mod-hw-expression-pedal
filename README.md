mod-hw-expression-pedal
=======================

This repository contains the schematics and PCB design files for the Expression Pedal hardware.
This is a peripheral meant to be used in conjunction with the MOD pedalboard (http://portalmod.com/) via its control-chain interface.

These files were created and can be improved with KiCAD, a free software Electronics CAD which is available at http://www.kicad-pcb.org/

## Check out instructions ##

This project uses a set of KiCAD pcb footprints created by the MOD dev-team (https://github.com/portalmod/mod-kicad-footprints). In order to properly fetch this dependency, which is configured as a "git submodule", you have to use the **--recursive** attribute in the following **git** command:

> git clone --recursive https://github.com/portalmod/mod-hw-expression-pedal.git

## 3d models ##

If you want to use the 3d-viewer, you will need to install the kicad-common package which provides (among other things) a set of 3d models of electronic components.

> sudo apt-get install kicad-common
